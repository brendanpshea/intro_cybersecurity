    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security principles help organizations protect valuable information assets and infrastructure from threats.
        \item \textbf{Defense in depth} is a strategy that employs multiple layers of security controls throughout the infrastructure.
        \item Effective security requires balancing protection with usability to avoid hindering business operations.
        \item Security planning should be proactive rather than reactive, anticipating threats before they materialize.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Key Security Principles}
        Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA triad) forms the foundation of information security planning.

    \frametitle{Infrastructure Security: The Big Picture}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Enterprise infrastructure encompasses all hardware, software, networks, and services supporting business operations.
        \item Security must be considered across all infrastructure components, not just at network boundaries.
        \item \textbf{Asset inventory} is the process of identifying and documenting all components requiring protection.
        \item Threat modeling helps identify potential vulnerabilities specific to your infrastructure.
    \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Understanding Security Zones: Segmentation Strategies}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Security zones} are logical or physical boundaries that separate systems based on sensitivity and trust levels.
        \item Proper segmentation reduces the lateral movement capability of attackers if one zone is compromised.
        \item Traffic between zones should be strictly controlled, monitored, and limited to necessary communications.
        \item Zone design should consider both physical locations and logical data classifications.

    \frametitle{Selecting Security Controls: Assessment Framework}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Security control selection should follow a structured approach based on risk assessment and business requirements.
        \item \textbf{Risk assessment} involves identifying assets, threats, vulnerabilities, and potential impacts to the organization.
        \item Controls should be selected based on their effectiveness in addressing identified risks and their alignment with the security strategy.
        \item Regular evaluation of control effectiveness helps refine the security posture over time.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Control Selection Process}
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Identify and categorize assets by criticality
            \item Assess threats and vulnerabilities
            \item Determine potential impacts and likelihood
            \item Evaluate control options (technical, administrative, physical)
            \item Select and implement appropriate controls

    \frametitle{Risk-Based Security Control Selection}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Risk-based security} focuses on allocating resources to protect the most critical assets based on threat likelihood and potential impact.
        \item Not all assets require the same level of protection—controls should be proportional to the value and vulnerability of the asset.
        \item Risk assessment should consider both quantitative factors (costs, probabilities) and qualitative factors (reputation, compliance).
        \item The goal is to achieve the optimal balance between security investment and risk reduction.
