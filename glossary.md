## Lecture 1: Security Controls

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Information Security | The practice of protecting data and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction through the application of various controls and measures. |
| Confidentiality | Ensuring that sensitive data is accessible only to authorized individuals, entities, or processes, and preventing disclosure to unauthorized parties. |
| Integrity | Maintaining and assuring the accuracy, consistency, and trustworthiness of data throughout its entire lifecycle, preventing unauthorized modification. |
| Availability | Ensuring that authorized users have reliable and timely access to resources, services, and information when needed. |
| Threat | Any potential danger that could exploit a vulnerability to breach security and cause harm to information assets or systems. |
| Vulnerability | A weakness or flaw in system security procedures, design, implementation, or internal controls that could be exploited to compromise security. |
| Exploit | A defined way to breach the security of an information system through a vulnerability, whether intentionally crafted malware or an inadvertent coding error. |
| Risk | The potential for loss, damage, or destruction of assets or data as a result of a threat exploiting a vulnerability. |
| Security Control | A safeguard or countermeasure prescribed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an information system. |
| Technical Control | Hardware and software mechanisms used to protect assets and control access, such as authentication systems, encryption, and intrusion detection systems. |
| Encryption | The process of converting data into a coded form to prevent unauthorized access, using mathematical algorithms and keys. |
| Firewalls | Network security systems that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. |
| Antivirus | Software designed to detect, prevent, and remove malicious software, including viruses, worms, trojans, and other types of malware. |
| Managerial Control | Administrative measures to manage security risks and protect assets, including policies, procedures, and guidelines. |
| Security Policy | A formal document that defines acceptable use, protection responsibilities, and security expectations for an organization's information technology resources. |
| Risk Assessment | A systematic process of evaluating potential risks and their likelihood of occurrence, analyzing vulnerabilities, and determining appropriate protective measures. |
| Compliance | Adhering to established rules, regulations, laws, and standards that are mandated by external authorities or internal policies. |
| Operational Control | Day-to-day security procedures and mechanisms implemented to protect assets and maintain secure operations. |
| Security Awareness | Educational programs and activities designed to ensure that personnel understand security risks and their responsibilities in protecting organizational assets. |
| Incident Response | A structured approach to handling and managing the aftermath of security breaches or cyberattacks, including detection, analysis, containment, and recovery. |
| Physical Control | Tangible measures implemented to prevent unauthorized physical access to resources, including barriers, locks, security guards, and surveillance systems. |
| Access Control System | A collection of mechanisms that work together to create a security architecture for controlling resource access based on authority levels and need. |
| Preventive Control | Measures designed to stop unwanted or unauthorized activities from occurring in the first place. |
| Deterrent Control | Mechanisms intended to discourage potential attackers by making the target appear less attractive or increasing the perceived risk of detection. |
| Psychological Deterrence | Methods that create fear of consequences or negative outcomes to discourage potential security violations. |
| Detective Control | Systems and procedures that identify and record significant events, security breaches, or attempted breaches after they have occurred. |
| Alert Threshold | A predetermined level or condition that, when reached, triggers a notification or response action in a security monitoring system. |
| Corrective Control | Measures designed to react to and reduce the impact of an incident that has already occurred, helping restore systems to normal operations. |
| Compensating Control | Alternative security measures implemented when primary controls cannot be employed due to legitimate business or technical constraints. |
| Patch | A piece of software designed to update a computer program or system to fix security vulnerabilities and other bugs. |
| Directive Control | Measures that direct, confine, or control actions by specifying proper procedures and behaviors to achieve security objectives. |
