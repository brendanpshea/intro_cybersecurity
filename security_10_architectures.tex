\begin{frame}{Introduction: Modern Architecture Models and Their Security Implications}
\begin{itemize}
\item Architecture decisions directly impact the security posture of any technology implementation.
\item Different architecture models present unique security advantages and challenges that must be evaluated.
\item Each architecture model shifts security responsibilities between different stakeholders.
\item Security must be integrated into architecture decisions from the beginning, not added afterward.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Key Consideration}
Architecture is not just about functionality and efficiencyâ€”it fundamentally determines what security controls are available and effective.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Security in Technology: Why Architecture Matters}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Security by Design} means embedding security principles into system architecture from the earliest planning stages.
\item Architecture choices determine attack surfaces, threat vectors, and available mitigation strategies.
\item Different architectures require different security tools, processes, and governance models.
\item Security trade-offs must be balanced with business requirements, technical constraints, and operational realities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example}
A microservices architecture increases the number of network connections but allows for more granular security controls compared to a monolithic application.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Cloud Computing: Fundamentals and Security Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Cloud computing} refers to the delivery of computing services over the internet, including servers, storage, databases, networking, and software.
\item Cloud services typically operate on a shared infrastructure model with logical separation between customers.
\item Security concerns include data privacy, regulatory compliance, and understanding new threat models.
\item Cloud providers invest heavily in security but require customers to configure services securely.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Cloud Service Models}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{IaaS} (Infrastructure as a Service): Provides virtualized computing resources
\item \textbf{PaaS} (Platform as a Service): Provides a platform for developing applications
\item \textbf{SaaS} (Software as a Service): Provides ready-to-use applications
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Shared Responsibility Matrix in Cloud Security}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Shared responsibility} means both cloud providers and customers are accountable for different aspects of security.
\item Cloud providers typically secure the underlying infrastructure, including physical hardware and virtualization layers.
\item Customers remain responsible for securing their data, applications, access management, and network configurations.
\item The division of responsibilities varies across different cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS). 
\end{itemize}
For example, in an IaaS model:
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\toprule
\textbf{Component} & \textbf{Provider Resp} & \textbf{Customer Resp} \\
\midrule
Physical Security & Full & None \\
Host Infrastructure & Full & None \\
Network Controls & Partial & Partial \\
Application Security & None & Full \\
Data Protection & None & Full \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Hybrid Cloud: Balancing Control and Flexibility}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Hybrid cloud} environments combine public cloud services with private cloud or on-premises infrastructure.
\item Security challenges include maintaining consistent policies across disparate environments.
\item Data transfers between environments create additional points of vulnerability requiring encryption and monitoring.
\item Identity and access management becomes more complex, requiring unified authentication systems.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Security Considerations for Hybrid Environments}
Managing the security boundary between public and private infrastructure is critical, as it becomes a potential weak point in the overall security architecture.
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Third-Party Vendors: Managing Security in the Supply Chain}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Supply chain security} addresses risks introduced by external vendors and service providers.
\item Organizations must develop vendor security assessment processes to evaluate third-party security practices.
\item Contractual agreements should include security requirements, data handling procedures, and breach notification terms.
\item Regular security audits and reviews of third-party access are essential for maintaining security.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Warning}
Major breaches often occur through compromised third-party vendors who have legitimate access to systems and data but weaker security controls.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Security Automation and Consistency}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Infrastructure as Code (IaC)} defines and manages infrastructure through machine-readable definition files rather than manual processes.
\item IaC improves security by ensuring consistent configuration and eliminating human error during deployments.
\item Security policies can be embedded in templates and automatically verified before deployment.
\item Version control for infrastructure code enables tracking of changes and facilitates security audits.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Example IaC Security Practice}
\begin{itemize}
\item Define resources with required security configurations

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Microservices: Security Challenges in Distributed Applications}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Microservices architecture} breaks applications into small, independently deployable services with specific business functions.
\item The increased number of network connections between services creates a larger attack surface.
\item Each microservice can implement different security controls appropriate to its specific risk profile.
\item Service-to-service authentication becomes critical to prevent unauthorized access between components.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Security Challenge}

\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Physical Network Isolation: Air-Gapped Systems and Their Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Air-gapped systems} are physically isolated from unsecured networks, with no direct connection to the internet or other unsecured networks.
\item Physical isolation provides strong protection against remote attacks and many forms of malware.
\item The security benefit comes at the cost of operational inconvenience and difficulties in patching and updates.
\item Even air-gapped systems remain vulnerable to insider threats, firmware attacks, and side-channel attacks.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Notable Air-Gap Breaches}
The Stuxnet malware successfully compromised air-gapped Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010 by spreading through USB drives, demonstrating that no isolation is perfect.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Logical Network Segmentation: Creating Security Boundaries}
\begin{itemize}

    \end{exampleblock}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{Centralized vs. Decentralized Architectures: Security Trade-offs}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Centralized architectures} consolidate resources, control, and security management in a single location or system.
    \item Centralization benefits include consistent security policy application and simplified monitoring.
    \item \textbf{Decentralized architectures} distribute resources and control across multiple locations or systems.
    \item Decentralization improves resilience against single-point failures but complicates security governance.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \textbf{Aspect} & \textbf{Centralized} & \textbf{Decentralized} \\
