\begin{frame}{Understanding Enterprise Security: Protecting Digital Assets}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Enterprise security} is the comprehensive protection of an organization's digital and physical assets from threats.
    \item Organizations face increasing threats from malware, hackers, insider threats, and social engineering attacks.
    \item Security breaches can result in financial loss, reputational damage, and legal consequences.
    \item An effective security strategy requires multiple layers of protection working together.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Key Question}
How can we modify existing enterprise capabilities to create a stronger security posture?
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Security Mindset: Thinking Like Both Defender and Attacker}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Effective security requires understanding how attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities.
    \item \textbf{Defense in depth} means implementing multiple security controls to protect a single asset.
    \item Security is a continuous process of assessment, implementation, monitoring, and improvement.
    \item The goal is not perfect security, but rather appropriate risk management based on threat models.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Important Concept}
The security mindset involves constantly asking: "What could go wrong?" and "How could someone bypass this control?"
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Security Principles: CIA Triad and Defense in Depth}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The \textbf{CIA triad} defines the three core goals of information security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.
    \item \textbf{Confidentiality} ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to have access.
    \item \textbf{Integrity} maintains and assures the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle.
    \item \textbf{Availability} ensures that information is accessible when needed by authorized users.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Defense in Depth Layers}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Physical security (barriers, locks, guards)
    \item Network security (firewalls, IDS/IPS, VPNs)
    \item System security (OS hardening, patching)
    \item Application security (secure coding, authentication)
    \item Data security (encryption, access controls)
\end{enumerate}
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Firewalls: Your First Line of Defense}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{firewall} is a network security device that monitors and filters incoming and outgoing network traffic.
        \item Firewalls operate at different layers of the OSI model, with packet filtering at layer 3 and application filtering at layer 7.
        \item Modern firewalls can inspect traffic contents to identify and block specific threats (deep packet inspection).
        \item Firewalls create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks to control information flow.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{table}
    \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \textbf{Firewall Type} & \textbf{OSI Layer} & \textbf{Primary Function} \\
    Packet Filter & 3-4 & Basic traffic filtering \\
    Stateful & 3-4 & Connection tracking \\
    Application & 7 & Content analysis \\
    Next-Generation & 3-7 & Integrated security \\
    \end{tabular}
    \end{table}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{Understanding Ports and Protocols: The Language of Network Traffic}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Ports} are logical endpoints that identify specific services on a networked device (ranging from 0-65535).
        \item \textbf{Protocols} define the rules and formats for exchanging data between networked devices.
        \item Common protocols include TCP (connection-oriented), UDP (connectionless), HTTP (web), and HTTPS (secure web).
        \item Security requires knowing which ports and protocols should be allowed and which should be blocked.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Common Secure vs. Insecure Protocols}
    \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \textbf{Insecure} & \textbf{Secure Alternative} \\
    HTTP (80) & HTTPS (443) \\
    Telnet (23) & SSH (22) \\
    FTP (21) & SFTP (22) \\
    SMTP (25) & SMTPS (465) \\
    \end{tabular}

    \begin{frame}{Firewall Configuration: Dunder Mifflin Paper Company}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Dunder Mifflin needs to protect its customer database and sales records while allowing employees to access resources.
            \item The IT department (led reluctantly by Dwight) implements a firewall separating the sales network from the warehouse network.
            \item Specific firewall rules allow salespeople to access the CRM system, but prevent unauthorized access to HR records.
            \item After Michael accidentally emails a client list to a competitor, outbound data filtering rules are added to prevent similar incidents.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{alertblock}{Dunder Mifflin's Firewall Rules}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Allow sales staff access to CRM from 8am-7pm only
            \item Block social media except during lunch hours (Ryan repeatedly bypasses this)
            \item Restrict access to accounting servers to accounting department IPs
            \item Block all traffic from Staples and Office Depot IP ranges (Michael's request)
        \end{itemize}
        \end{alertblock}
        \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{Screened Subnets: Creating Security Zones in Your Network}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A \textbf{screened subnet} (also called DMZ) is a network segment that acts as a buffer zone between trusted and untrusted networks.
        \item Servers that need external access (web, email, DNS) are placed in the DMZ to limit exposure.
        \item Multiple firewalls create boundaries between the internet, DMZ, and internal network.
        \item This architecture contains breaches, preventing direct access to internal resources if DMZ systems are compromised.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Zone-Based Security Model}
    The network is divided into security zones (Internet, DMZ, Internal) with distinct trust levels, and traffic between zones is tightly controlled by firewall policies.
    \end{block}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{Writing Effective Firewall Rules: Best Practices}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Firewall rules} define what traffic is allowed or denied based on source, destination, and service.
        \item Rules should follow the principle of least privilege, allowing only necessary traffic.
        \item Rule order mattersâ€”most firewalls process rules sequentially until a match is found.
        \item Regular rule review and cleanup prevents rule bloat and potential security gaps.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Example Rule Logic}
    "Allow HTTP and HTTPS traffic from the internal network to the web server, but deny all other traffic to that server."
    \end{exampleblock}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}{Access Control Lists (ACLs): Who Gets In and Who Doesn't}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Access Control Lists (ACLs)} are ordered sets of rules that determine which traffic is permitted or denied.
        \item ACLs filter traffic based on various criteria like IP addresses, ports, protocols, and traffic direction.
        \item Standard ACLs filter based on source address only, while extended ACLs can filter on multiple criteria.
        \item Well-designed ACLs balance security requirements with operational needs of the organization.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{ACL Best Practices}
    Create specific rather than general rules, place most frequently matched rules first (when possible), and document the purpose of each rule.
    \end{block}
    \end{frame}

    \begin{frame}{IDS vs. IPS: Detection and Active Response}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item An \textbf{Intrusion Detection System (IDS)} monitors network traffic for suspicious activity and alerts security teams.
            \item An \textbf{Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)} actively blocks detected threats in addition to alerting.
            \item Both systems can be network-based (monitoring traffic) or host-based (monitoring system activities).
            \item Modern solutions often combine IDS/IPS functionality with other security controls into unified platforms.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
        \textbf{Feature} & \textbf{IDS} & \textbf{IPS} \\
        \hline
        Placement & Mirror/Span Port & Inline \\
        Response & Passive (Alerts) & Active (Blocks) \\
        Latency & Low Impact & Potential Impact \\
        False Positive Risk & Detection Only & Potential Disruption \\
        \end{tabular}
        \end{frame}
        
        \begin{frame}{Tracking Attack Trends: Staying Ahead of Threats}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Attack trends} are patterns in cyber attacks over time, showing evolving tactics and targets.
            \item Understanding trends helps organizations prioritize security resources and controls.
            \item Threat intelligence feeds provide information about emerging threats and attack methodologies.
            \item IDS/IPS systems must be regularly updated to detect the latest attack patterns.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{alertblock}{Recent Attack Trends}
        Ransomware attacks, supply chain compromises, zero-day exploits, and credential-based attacks have seen significant increases in recent years.
        \end{alertblock}
        \end{frame}
        
        \begin{frame}{Signature-Based Detection: Recognizing Known Threats}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Signature-based detection} identifies threats by matching traffic patterns against a database of known attack signatures.
            \item Signatures can include specific byte sequences, known malicious IP addresses, or suspicious packet structures.
            \item This detection method is very effective against known threats but cannot detect novel attacks (zero-days).
            \item Regular signature updates are essential to maintain protection against new threats.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{block}{Beyond Signatures}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Anomaly detection}: Identifies deviations from normal behavior
            \item \textbf{Heuristic analysis}: Uses rules and algorithms to detect suspicious behavior
            \item \textbf{Behavioral analysis}: Learns normal patterns and flags exceptions
        \end{itemize}
        \end{block}
        \end{frame}

        \begin{frame}{IDS Implementation: Pawnee Parks Department}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item The Pawnee Parks Department installs an IDS after Ron discovers unauthorized access to park planning documents.
                \item The system monitors network traffic for suspicious patterns that might indicate unauthorized access attempts.
                \item When April accidentally runs a port scan while trying to install a game, the IDS alerts the IT department.
                \item Leslie requests regular reports on detected threats to demonstrate the department's commitment to cybersecurity.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{exampleblock}{Recent IDS Alert: "Gryzzl" Data Mining Attempt}
            The Pawnee Parks Department IDS detected unusual scanning activity from IP addresses belonging to Gryzzl, a tech company interested in Pawnee real estate data. The scanning targeted citizen records databases, attempting to access personal information about residents near potential development sites.

            \end{frame}
        
        \begin{frame}{Web Filtering Approaches: Agent-Based vs. Centralized Proxy}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Web filtering} technologies restrict access to websites based on content, security risk, or organizational policies.
            \item \textbf{Agent-based filtering} installs software on individual devices to enforce browsing policies locally.
            \item \textbf{Centralized proxy filtering} routes all web traffic through a proxy server that applies filtering policies.
            \item Each approach has trade-offs in terms of management complexity, effectiveness for remote users, and performance impact.
        \end{itemize}
        
        \begin{exampleblock}{Comparison of Approaches}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Agent-Based}: Better for mobile/remote users; challenging to maintain across diverse devices
            \item \textbf{Centralized Proxy}: Easier central management; potential single point of failure
            \item \textbf{Hybrid}: Combines both approaches for comprehensive coverage
        \end{itemize}

            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{URL scanning} examines web addresses to identify potentially malicious websites before connection.
                \item \textbf{Content categorization} classifies websites into categories (e.g., social media, gambling, news) for policy enforcement.
                \item Dynamic categorization updates continuously as new websites emerge and existing ones change.
                \item Organizations create web access policies based on these categories to align with business needs and security requirements.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{block}{Common Content Categories}

            \begin{frame}{Block Rules and Reputation Systems: Making Smart Filtering Decisions}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{Block rules} define which web content is prohibited based on categories, keywords, or specific URLs.
                \item \textbf{Reputation systems} score websites based on historical behavior, ownership, age, and security incidents.
                \item Low-reputation sites are more likely to contain malware or engage in phishing even if their content seems legitimate.
                \item Effective filtering combines multiple technologies: categorization, reputation, and real-time content analysis.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{alertblock}{Warning Signs of Malicious Websites}
            Recently registered domains, misspelled brand names, unusual TLDs, sites requesting excessive permissions, and poor reputation scores are common indicators of potentially malicious websites.

            \begin{frame}{Hardening the OS: Removing Unnecessary Services}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item \textbf{OS hardening} is the process of securing an operating system by reducing its attack surface.
                \item Unnecessary services, applications, and features provide potential entry points for attackers.
                \item Each running service increases the number of potential vulnerabilities in a system.
                \item Minimizing installed components and disabling unused services follows the principle of least functionality.
            \end{itemize}
            
            \begin{exampleblock}{OS Hardening Checklist}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Remove or disable unnecessary services and applications
                \item Apply all security patches and updates
                \item Configure strong authentication mechanisms
                \item Implement the principle of least privilege for accounts

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item \textbf{SELinux} (Security-Enhanced Linux) is a security architecture that implements mandatory access controls in Linux.
                    \item Traditional discretionary access controls rely solely on file permissions and ownership.
                    \item SELinux adds context-based controls where access depends on the security context of processes and resources.
                    \item This provides protection against privilege escalation attacks and restricts what compromised applications can access.

                    \begin{itemize}
                        \item \textbf{DNS filtering} inspects and controls DNS queries to prevent connections to malicious or unauthorized domains.
                        \item When a user attempts to visit a blocked domain, the DNS resolver returns an alternative response instead of the real IP address.
                        \item This technology can block malware command and control servers, phishing sites, and policy-restricted content.
                        \item DNS filtering provides an additional security layer that works regardless of which browser or application is used.
