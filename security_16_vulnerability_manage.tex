\frametitle{Understanding Vulnerability Management: An Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vulnerability management} is the continuous process of identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting security vulnerabilities in systems and software.
\item Organizations implement vulnerability management to proactively identify weaknesses before they can be exploited by threat actors.
\item Effective vulnerability management requires coordination between security teams, IT operations, and business stakeholders.
\item A mature vulnerability management program significantly reduces an organization's attack surface and overall security risk.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Key Concept}
Vulnerability management is not a one-time task but an ongoing cycle that must be continuously maintained and improved to address new threats.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle}
\begin{itemize}
\item The vulnerability management process follows a cyclical lifecycle with distinct phases that feed into each other.
\item \textbf{Identification} involves discovering vulnerabilities through various scanning and testing methodologies.
\item \textbf{Analysis} includes confirming, prioritizing, and classifying vulnerabilities based on risk factors.
\item \textbf{Remediation} covers patching, implementing controls, and other actions to address confirmed vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Why Vulnerability Management Matters: Risks and Impacts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Unpatched vulnerabilities represent one of the most common attack vectors exploited by threat actors to gain access to systems.
\item Security breaches resulting from known vulnerabilities can lead to significant financial losses, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.
\item The average time to exploit a new vulnerability has decreased from months to days or even hours in today's threat landscape.
\item Effective vulnerability management is a compliance requirement for many regulatory frameworks including PCI DSS, HIPAA, and SOC 2.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Real-World Impact}
The 2017 Equifax breach, which exposed personal data of 147 million people, resulted from an unpatched Apache Struts vulnerability that had been publicly disclosed two months prior to the attack.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vulnerability Scanning: Finding System Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vulnerability scanning} is the automated process of proactively identifying security vulnerabilities in networks, systems, and applications.
\item Scanners compare system characteristics against databases of known vulnerabilities to identify potential security issues.
\item Regular scanning creates a baseline of system security and helps track remediation progress over time.
\item Most compliance frameworks require vulnerability scanning at specified intervals (typically monthly or quarterly).
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Scanner Types}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Network scanners}: Examine open ports, services, and network configurations
\item \textbf{Web application scanners}: Test for OWASP Top 10 and other web vulnerabilities
\item \textbf{Database scanners}: Check for misconfigurations and security issues in database systems
\item \textbf{Host-based scanners}: Assess operating systems and installed software vulnerabilities
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Types of Vulnerability Scans and Their Applications}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Authenticated scans} use valid credentials to examine systems internally, providing more comprehensive results than unauthenticated scans.
\item \textbf{Unauthenticated scans} test from an external perspective, similar to how an attacker might initially probe systems.
\item \textbf{Discovery scans} identify all assets on a network, helping ensure complete visibility of the attack surface.
\item \textbf{Compliance scans} specifically check for vulnerabilities relevant to regulatory requirements like PCI DSS or HIPAA.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\begin{tabular}{lp{7cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Scan Frequency} & \textbf{Typical Use Case} \\
\midrule
Daily & Critical internet-facing systems \\
Weekly & High-value internal systems \\
Monthly & Standard business systems \\
Quarterly & Minimum for compliance requirements \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Introduction to Application Security Testing}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Application security testing} is the process of analyzing and testing applications for security vulnerabilities throughout the software development lifecycle.
\item Early detection of vulnerabilities in the development process can reduce remediation costs by 60-100x compared to fixing issues in production.
\item Modern DevSecOps practices integrate security testing into continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
\item Application security testing encompasses multiple complementary approaches that find different types of vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{DevSecOps Integration}
\scriptsize
Shifting security testing "left" (earlier) in the development process helps catch vulnerabilities before they reach production environments, significantly reducing security risk and remediation costs.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Static Analysis: Examining Code Without Execution}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Static Application Security Testing (SAST)} analyzes source code, bytecode, or binary code without executing the application.
\item SAST tools scan for coding patterns that indicate security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, buffer overflows, and insecure cryptographic practices.
\item Static analysis can detect vulnerabilities early in the development cycle, even before the application is in a runnable state.
\item SAST tools typically integrate with code repositories and development environments to provide immediate feedback to developers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Common SAST Findings}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Hardcoded credentials in source code
\item Use of unsafe functions (e.g., strcpy in C)
\item Failure to validate user input
\item Improper error handling exposing sensitive information
\end{itemize}
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dynamic Analysis: Testing Applications in Runtime}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)} examines running applications by simulating attacks against them.
\item DAST tools interact with application interfaces to identify runtime vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting, session management issues, and server misconfigurations.
\item Unlike SAST, dynamic analysis can detect vulnerabilities that only appear during application execution, such as authentication issues.
\item DAST provides an "attacker's perspective" by testing the application as deployed in a specific environment.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{SAST vs. DAST Comparison}
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{4cm}|}
\hline
\textbf{SAST} & \textbf{DAST} \\
\hline
Examines source code & Tests running application \\
\hline
Finds implementation flaws & Finds functional vulnerabilities \\
\hline
Language/framework dependent & Technology agnostic \\
\hline
Early in development cycle & Later in development cycle \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Package Monitoring: Tracking Dependencies and Components}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Package monitoring} involves tracking third-party libraries, frameworks, and components used in applications for security vulnerabilities.
\item Modern applications often contain hundreds of dependencies, each potentially introducing security vulnerabilities into the application.
\item \textbf{Software Composition Analysis (SCA)} tools automate the process of identifying vulnerable components and alerting teams to necessary updates.
\item Package monitoring should include version tracking, license compliance, and end-of-life/support status for all dependencies.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Software Supply Chain Risk}
\scriptsize
The 2021 Log4j vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228) demonstrated how a vulnerability in a widely-used component can affect thousands of applications. Organizations without effective package monitoring struggled to identify all affected systems, leading to prolonged exposure.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Threat Feeds: Staying Updated on Current Vulnerabilities}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Threat feeds} provide streams of information about new vulnerabilities, exploits, and threats as they emerge.
\item Organizations use threat intelligence feeds to stay informed about vulnerabilities relevant to their technology stack and industry.
\item Effective use of threat feeds enables security teams to prioritize patching based on real-world exploit activity rather than just vulnerability severity scores.
\item Threat feeds can be integrated with security tools to automate vulnerability detection and response processes.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Actionable Intelligence}
\scriptsize
The value of threat feeds lies in their actionability. Organizations should focus on feeds that provide context and relevance to their specific environment rather than consuming raw data without filtering.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) in Vulnerability Discovery}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)} leverages publicly available information sources to identify vulnerabilities and security issues.
\item Security researchers often publish vulnerability details, proof-of-concept exploits, and mitigation strategies through blogs, forums, and social media.
\item OSINT can provide early warning about zero-day vulnerabilities before official patches or advisories are released.
\item Organizations can use OSINT to understand how their public-facing assets might appear to potential attackers.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Common OSINT Sources for Vulnerability Information}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Security researcher blogs and social media accounts
\item Public vulnerability databases (NVD, Exploit-DB)
\item Code repositories (GitHub, GitLab)
\item Academic security research publications
\item Security conference presentations and materials
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Proprietary and Third-Party Threat Intelligence}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Proprietary threat intelligence} is commercial information provided by specialized security vendors based on their research and monitoring capabilities.
\item Third-party intelligence services often have visibility into threats across multiple organizations and industries, providing broader context than in-house monitoring alone.
\item Commercial threat intelligence typically includes detailed analysis, attribution information, and tactical recommendations not available in public sources.
\item Organizations should evaluate threat intelligence providers based on coverage relevant to their technology stack and industry-specific threats.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{7cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Intelligence Type} & \textbf{Primary Value} \\
\midrule
Strategic & Long-term planning and risk management \\
Tactical & Day-to-day security operations and defense \\
Technical & Specific indicators and signatures for detection \\
Operational & Attacker TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Information-Sharing Organizations: Collaborative Security}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs)} and \textbf{Information Sharing and Analysis Organizations (ISAOs)} facilitate threat intelligence sharing among organizations within specific sectors.
\item These collaborative communities enable members to share vulnerability information, attack indicators, and mitigation strategies in a trusted environment.
\item Industry-specific sharing groups provide contextual intelligence about threats targeting particular sectors (e.g., financial services, healthcare, energy).
\item Participation in information-sharing organizations helps organizations prepare for emerging threats before they directly experience them.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Notable Information-Sharing Organizations}
\scriptsize
The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center (FS-ISAC) allows financial institutions to anonymously share information about cyber threats, helping the entire sector improve its security posture against common adversaries.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Dark Web Intelligence: Understanding Emerging Threats}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{dark web} contains forums, marketplaces, and communication channels where threat actors discuss and trade vulnerability information and exploit tools.
\item Monitoring dark web activity can provide early warning about vulnerabilities being actively exploited in the wild.
\item Dark web intelligence can reveal which vulnerabilities threat actors consider most valuable or exploitable, helping prioritize patching efforts.
\item Organizations may use specialized services to monitor the dark web for mentions of their assets, data, or industry-specific attacks.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Ethical Considerations}
\scriptsize
Organizations must ensure that their dark web intelligence gathering activities comply with legal and ethical standards. Direct engagement with illegal forums or marketplaces may violate laws and create additional risks.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Penetration Testing: Going Beyond Automated Scans}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Penetration testing} involves skilled security professionals attempting to exploit vulnerabilities in systems, networks, and applications to identify security weaknesses.
\item Unlike automated scanning, penetration testing can identify complex vulnerabilities requiring multiple steps to exploit or involving business logic flaws.
\item Penetration testers simulate real-world attack scenarios, providing insights into how attackers might chain together multiple vulnerabilities.
\item Tests can be conducted with different levels of knowledge about the target systems (black box, gray box, or white box approaches).
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Penetration Testing Methodologies}
\tiny
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{External testing}: Assessing internet-facing assets and perimeter defenses
\item \textbf{Internal testing}: Evaluating security from within the network
\item \textbf{Social engineering}: Testing human vulnerabilities through phishing or other deception
\item \textbf{Physical testing}: Attempting to bypass physical security controls
\item \textbf{Red team exercises}: Extended campaigns simulating sophisticated threat actors
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Responsible Disclosure Programs: Working with Researchers}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Responsible disclosure programs} provide formal channels for security researchers to report vulnerabilities they discover in an organization's systems or applications.
\item These programs establish clear guidelines for researchers, including scope, reporting process, and expectations for disclosure timelines.
\item Responsible disclosure helps organizations learn about vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them.
\item Well-structured programs specify what constitutes acceptable testing methods and legal safe harbors for good-faith security research.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Key Components of a Disclosure Policy}
\scriptsize
A good responsible disclosure policy clearly defines the systems in scope, provides a secure reporting mechanism (e.g., encrypted email), outlines the expected timeframe for organizational response, and explains how researchers will be acknowledged for their contributions.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Bug Bounty Programs: Incentivizing Security Research}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Bug bounty programs} extend responsible disclosure by offering financial rewards or other incentives for reporting valid security vulnerabilities.
\item Bounties typically scale with the severity of the vulnerability, creating motivation for researchers to find high-impact issues.
\item Programs can be private (invitation-only) or public (open to all researchers), depending on the organization's risk tolerance and maturity.
\item Bug bounty platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd facilitate program management, triage, and researcher payments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{8cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Bounty Type} & \textbf{Description} \\
\midrule
Tiered & Fixed rewards based on vulnerability severity categories \\
Formula-based & Dynamic calculation considering impact, exploitability factors \\
Progressive & Increasing rewards for finding vulnerabilities in critical systems \\
Time-based & Higher rewards during focused testing periods or product launches \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{System and Process Audits: Comprehensive Vulnerability Assessment}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{System and process audits} evaluate both technical controls and the operational procedures that support effective vulnerability management.
\item Audits typically review documentation, interview personnel, observe processes, and test controls to identify gaps and weaknesses.
\item Regular audits help ensure that vulnerability management activities meet compliance requirements and organizational security policies.
\item Third-party audits provide independent verification of security practices and can identify blind spots missed by internal teams.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Key Audit Focus Areas}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Completeness of asset inventory and scan coverage
\item Timeliness of vulnerability remediation
\item Patch management effectiveness
\item Exception handling and documentation
\item Risk acceptance processes and approvals
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Confirming Vulnerabilities: Beyond Initial Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vulnerability confirmation} is the process of verifying that detected vulnerabilities are genuine and applicable to the specific environment.
\item Confirmation may involve manual testing, analyzing configuration details, or deploying proof-of-concept exploits in controlled environments.
\item Accurate confirmation helps eliminate false positives that could waste remediation resources and distract from genuine threats.
\item The confirmation process should document evidence of the vulnerability and any contextual factors affecting its risk level.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Vulnerability Confirmation Process}
\scriptsize
All potential high and critical vulnerabilities should undergo a confirmation process before remediation activities begin. This ensures that limited security resources focus on addressing real rather than theoretical risks.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{False Positives and False Negatives: Accuracy Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item A \textbf{false positive} occurs when a vulnerability is incorrectly identified as present in a system when it actually doesn't exist.
\item A \textbf{false negative} happens when a scanner fails to detect a vulnerability that is actually present, creating a dangerous blind spot.
\item High false positive rates can lead to "alert fatigue" and waste resources, while false negatives create an illusion of security.
\item Mature vulnerability management programs track and measure false positive/negative rates to improve scanning accuracy over time.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Impact of False Results}
A security team spending time investigating false positives may miss genuine threats, while false negatives leave systems vulnerable despite appearing secure in reports. Both undermine confidence in the vulnerability management process and create security risks.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Prioritization Frameworks for Vulnerability Management}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vulnerability prioritization} is the process of determining which vulnerabilities should be addressed first based on risk factors.
\item Effective prioritization helps organizations focus limited resources on remediating the vulnerabilities that pose the greatest actual risk.
\item Prioritization frameworks typically consider factors beyond just technical severity, including business impact and threat intelligence.
\item Best practice approaches combine automated scoring with human analysis for critical systems and vulnerabilities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Common Prioritization Factors}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item Technical severity (CVSS score)
\item Asset value and sensitivity
\item Exploitability in the wild
\item Exposure (internet-facing vs. internal)
\item Compensating controls
\item Business impact of exploitation
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Understanding the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)}
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)} is a standardized framework for rating the severity of security vulnerabilities.
\item CVSS scores range from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating greater severity based on exploitability and impact metrics.
\item The system includes base, temporal, and environmental metrics to provide context-specific scoring.
\item CVSS version 3.1 includes metrics for attack vector, complexity, privileges required, user interaction, scope, and various impact factors.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{ccp{7cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{CVSS Score} & \textbf{Severity} & \textbf{Typical Handling} \\
\midrule
9.0 - 10.0 & Critical & Immediate remediation (24-48 hours) \\
7.0 - 8.9 & High & Prioritized remediation (1-2 weeks) \\
4.0 - 6.9 & Medium & Standard remediation cycle (1 month) \\
0.1 - 3.9 & Low & Scheduled with regular maintenance \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Common Vulnerability Enumeration (CVE): Standardizing Vulnerability Information}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)} is a reference system that provides unique identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.
\item Each CVE entry includes a number (e.g., CVE-2021-44228), description, and references to related resources.
\item The CVE system enables clear communication about specific vulnerabilities across tools, databases, and organizations.
\item CVE entries are maintained by the MITRE Corporation and feed into the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{CVE Entry Example}
\scriptsize
\textbf{CVE-2021-44228}: Apache Log4j2 JNDI features do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Vulnerability Classification: Categorizing Security Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Vulnerability classification} involves categorizing vulnerabilities based on their nature, affected components, and attack vectors.
\item Common classification systems include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and OWASP Top 10 for web applications.
\item Classification helps organizations identify patterns and systemic issues across multiple vulnerabilities.
\item Understanding vulnerability classes enables more effective preventive measures and developer training.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Common Vulnerability Classes}
\scriptsize
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Input validation issues}: SQL injection, XSS, command injection
\item \textbf{Authentication flaws}: Weak credentials, session management issues
\item \textbf{Access control weaknesses}: Missing authorization checks
\item \textbf{Cryptographic problems}: Weak algorithms, improper implementation
\item \textbf{Configuration issues}: Default settings, unnecessary services
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Exposure Factor: Measuring Potential Impact}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Exposure factor} is a measure of the percentage of asset value that would be lost if a vulnerability were successfully exploited.
\item Calculating exposure factor requires understanding both technical vulnerability severity and the business value of affected assets.
\item Exposure factors can vary widely for the same vulnerability depending on the specific deployment context and data sensitivity.
\item Organizations use exposure factor analysis to quantify potential losses and justify security investments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Exposure Factor Calculation}
\scriptsize
If a database server contains customer data valued at \$10 million, and a critical SQL injection vulnerability could result in 60\% of that data being compromised, the exposure factor is 0.6 with a potential loss of \$6 million.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Environmental Variables in Vulnerability Assessment}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Environmental variables} are contextual factors specific to an organization that affect the actual risk posed by a vulnerability.
\item These variables include network architecture, deployed security controls, and the specific configuration of vulnerable systems.
\item CVSS v3 includes environmental metrics that allow organizations to customize scores based on their specific context.
\item Considering environmental variables prevents both over- and under-estimation of vulnerability risks.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Key Environmental Factors}
\scriptsize
Environmental factors that can significantly modify vulnerability risk include network segmentation, firewall rules, intrusion detection/prevention systems, application whitelisting, and privileged access management controls.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Industry and Organizational Impact Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
\item The impact of the same vulnerability can vary dramatically across different industries due to regulatory requirements and the nature of protected data.
\item Organizations handling sensitive data (healthcare, financial services) typically face higher consequences from security breaches.
\item Industry-specific concerns include intellectual property protection, safety-critical systems, and compliance with sector regulations.
\item Organizational factors like size, public profile, and customer expectations also affect vulnerability impact assessments.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{3cm}p{8cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Industry} & \textbf{Key Impact Considerations} \\
\midrule
Healthcare & Patient safety, PHI protection, HIPAA compliance \\
Financial & Financial fraud, transaction integrity, PCI DSS \\
Manufacturing & Intellectual property, operational technology \\
Government & National security, citizen data, compliance \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Risk Tolerance: Setting Acceptable Thresholds}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk tolerance} defines the level of security risk an organization is willing to accept based on business objectives and constraints.
    \item Organizations must establish clear risk acceptance criteria, including who can approve acceptance of specific risk levels.
    \item Risk tolerance varies by system criticality, with stricter thresholds for mission-critical or customer-facing systems.
    \item Formal risk acceptance processes ensure that business leaders understand and explicitly approve security trade-offs.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Risk Acceptance Authority}
    \scriptsize
Risk acceptance should be approved by individuals with appropriate authority relative to the risk level. For example, low-risk exceptions might be approved by IT managers, while high or critical risks require executive or board-level approval.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Patching Strategies: Addressing Vulnerabilities Directly}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Patching} is the process of applying updates to software and systems to fix known vulnerabilities.
    \item Effective patch management requires established processes for testing, deploying, and verifying patches across the environment.
    \item Organizations should develop risk-based patching schedules that balance security needs with operational stability.
    \item Automated patch management tools can improve efficiency and reduce the time between patch availability and deployment.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Patch Management Lifecycle}
\scriptsize
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Patch identification and acquisition
    \item Risk assessment and prioritization
    \item Testing in non-production environment
    \item Approval and change management
    \item Production deployment
    \item Verification and documentation
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Cyber Insurance: Risk Transfer Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Cyber insurance} is a risk transfer mechanism that provides financial protection against losses resulting from cyber attacks and data breaches.
    \item Insurance policies may cover incident response costs, business interruption losses, liability claims, and regulatory penalties.
    \item Insurers typically require evidence of baseline security controls, including vulnerability management programs.
    \item Organizations should understand policy exclusions, which often include acts of war, unpatched known vulnerabilities, and social engineering.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Insurance Requirements}
    \scriptsize
Many cyber insurance policies now require specific vulnerability management practices as a condition of coverage, such as patching critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and maintaining regular scanning schedules for internet-facing systems.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Network Segmentation as a Mitigation Strategy}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Network segmentation} involves dividing a network into isolated segments to limit the spread of attacks and contain security breaches.
    \item Segmentation can function as a compensating control when vulnerabilities cannot be directly patched.
    \item Effective segmentation includes both network-level controls (VLANs, firewalls) and application-level restrictions.
    \item Zero Trust architectures extend segmentation principles by requiring verification of every access request regardless of source.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}
\scriptsize
\centering
\begin{tabular}{p{4cm}p{7cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Segmentation Approach} & \textbf{Key Characteristics} \\
\midrule
Network-level & VLANs, subnets, firewalls, ACLs \\
Application-level & API gateways, service meshes \\
Data-level & Encryption, access controls \\
Identity-based & Zero Trust, least privilege \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Implementing Compensating Controls When Patches Aren't Viable}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Compensating controls} are security measures implemented when the primary control (such as patching) cannot be applied.
        \item These alternative controls should provide a similar level of protection to address the underlying vulnerability risk.
        \item Common situations requiring compensating controls include legacy systems, operational constraints, and third-party applications.
        \item Compensating controls should be documented, tested, and regularly reviewed for continued effectiveness.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Examples of Compensating Controls}
    \scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Web Application Firewalls (WAF) to filter malicious traffic
        \item Host-based intrusion prevention systems
        \item Enhanced monitoring and alerting
        \item Application whitelisting
        \item Network-level access restrictions
    \end{itemize}
    \end{block}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Exceptions and Exemptions: Managing Accepted Vulnerabilities}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Security exceptions} are formal approvals to deviate from standard security requirements for a specific vulnerability or system.
        \item Exception processes should include business justification, risk assessment, compensating controls, and time limitations.
        \item All exceptions should have an expiration date to ensure periodic reevaluation of the risk and mitigation strategy.
        \item Organizations should maintain a central registry of approved exceptions to provide visibility into accepted risks.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Exception Management}
    \scriptsize
    Exceptions should never become permanent. An effective exception process includes escalating approval requirements for renewals and requires evidence that remediation plans are progressing toward eventual resolution of the vulnerability.
    \end{alertblock}
    \end{frame}
    
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Validation Techniques: Confirming Successful Remediation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Validation} is the process of verifying that remediation actions have effectively addressed identified vulnerabilities.
        \item Rescanning systems after patching confirms the vulnerability is no longer present and avoids false assumptions about remediation effectiveness.
        \item For critical systems, validation may include both automated scanning and manual testing or review.
