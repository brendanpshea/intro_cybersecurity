\frametitle{Securing the Enterprise: Why Mitigation Matters}

\begin{block}{Security Mitigation}
\textbf{Security mitigation} refers to measures taken to reduce the severity or impact of security threats.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\item Security threats to enterprises have increased by over 300\% in the past decade.
\item A single data breach costs organizations an average of \$4.35 million globally.
\item \textbf{Proactive mitigation} is significantly more cost-effective than reactive responses.
\item Effective security requires multiple layers of protection working together.
\item Regulatory compliance often mandates specific security controls and mitigation strategies.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Why Enterprises Are Targeted}
Enterprises are attractive targets because they have valuable data, larger attack surfaces, and often complex systems that can be difficult to secure completely.

% Slide 3: "Defense in Depth: A Layered Approach to Security"
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Defense in Depth: A Layered Approach to Security}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Defense in depth} is a security strategy that employs multiple layers of controls throughout the IT environment.
\item No single security measure is 100\% effective against all possible attacks.
\item Layered security requires attackers to overcome multiple barriers, increasing difficulty..
\end{itemize}

% Slide 4: "Network Segmentation: Creating Security Boundaries"
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Network Segmentation: Creating Security Boundaries}

\begin{block}{What is Network Segmentation?}
\textbf{Network segmentation} is the practice of dividing a network into isolated subnetworks to improve security and performance.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\item Segmentation limits lateral movement of threats across the network.
\item Sensitive systems and data can be isolated in secure network segments.
\item Segmentation helps contain breaches when they occur, limiting potential damage.
\item It supports compliance requirements by restricting access to regulated data.
\item Modern segmentation includes both physical and logical boundaries.
\end{itemize}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Iron Man's Network Security}
    In the Marvel universe, Tony Stark implements extensive segmentation to protect his lab and sensitive Iron Man technology.
    \end{exampleblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Stark isolates his lab network completely from Stark Industries' corporate network.
    \item He implements air-gapped systems for his most sensitive Iron Man suit designs.
    \item If his corporate network is compromised, his personal lab remained secure.
    \item Different security clearances exist for different areas of his technology.
    \item IDS and other tools provide continuous monitoring of boundary crossing attempts.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \vspace{0.3cm}
    \textit{Key lesson: Proper segmentation ensures that a breach in one area doesn't compromise everything.}

    % Slide 6: "Implementing Effective Segmentation Strategies"
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Implementing Effective Segmentation Strategies}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Begin with a thorough \textbf{asset inventory} to understand what needs protection.
    \item Group systems based on function, data sensitivity, and compliance requirements.
    \item Implement \textbf{network access controls} between segments using firewalls and ACLs.
    \item Consider both north-south (external-internal) and east-west (internal) traffic flows.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Modern Segmentation Approaches}
    Beyond traditional VLANs, consider:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Micro-segmentation}: Security policies applied at the individual workload level
    \item \textbf{Software-defined segmentation}: Dynamic, policy-based controls
    \item \textbf{Zero Trust architecture}: "Never trust, always verify" approach to access

    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Access Control Fundamentals: The Four W's}
    
    \begin{block}{What is Access Control?}
    \textbf{Access control} refers to security mechanisms that regulate who or what can view, use, or access a resource.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Who} - Identity verification determines which users can access systems.
    \item \textbf{What} - Authorization determines which resources users can access.
    \item \textbf{When} - Time-based restrictions limit when access is permitted.
    \item \textbf{Where} - Location-based controls determine from where users can connect.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{tabular}{|l|l|}

    \begin{columns}[T]
    \column{0.5\textwidth}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item An \textbf{Access Control List (ACL)} is a table that tells a system which access rights each user has.
    \item ACLs can be implemented at various levels:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Network ACLs - Control traffic flow
        \item File system ACLs - Control file access
        \item Application ACLs - Control feature access

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Permissions Architecture: Building the Right Framework}
    
    \begin{block}{What are Permissions?}
    \textbf{Permissions} are specific access rights assigned to users or groups that determine what actions they can perform on specific resources.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Permissions should be organized in a structured, hierarchical manner.
    \item Common permission types include read, write, execute, modify, and full control.
    \item Group-based permissions are easier to manage than individual user permissions.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{table}
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
    \hline
    \textbf{Permission Model} & \textbf{Description} \\

    \begin{exampleblock}{Hogwarts Library Security}
    In the Harry Potter series, the Restricted Section of the Hogwarts library contains dangerous knowledge that should only be accessible to advanced students with professor approval.
    \end{exampleblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Access control measure: Required signed permission note from a professor.
    \item Authentication weakness: No verification system to confirm note authenticity.
    \item Monitoring failure: No surveillance during overnight hours.
    \item Physical control bypass: Harry's invisibility cloak allowed unauthorized access.
    \item Result: Harry accessed dangerous knowledge about Horcruxes that should have been restricted.
    \end{itemize}

    % Slide 11: "Application Allow Lists: Controlling What Runs in Your Environment"
    \begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Application Allow Lists: Controlling What Runs in Your Environment}
    
    \begin{block}{What is an Application Allow List?}
    An \textbf{application allow list} (or whitelist) is a security approach that permits only approved applications to run while blocking all others by default.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Allow lists provide stronger protection than block lists (blacklists) of known malicious software.
    \item They effectively prevent unauthorized and potentially malicious applications from executing.
    \item Implementation can be based on file paths, cryptographic hashes, digital signatures, or publisher certificates.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{exampleblock}{Implementation Methods}

    \begin{exampleblock}{Security Through Isolation}
    In "The Martian," astronaut Mark Watney's survival on Mars demonstrates how isolation can be both a challenge and a security strategy.
    \end{exampleblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Watney physically isolated critical systems (habitat, rover, communications) to prevent cascade failures.
    \item He created redundant, isolated food production systems to ensure survival if one failed.
    \item When breaching the airlock for modifications, he isolated sections to contain potential atmospheric loss.
    \item His improvised communications system was isolated from critical life support to prevent interference.
    \item NASA similarly isolated mission-critical systems from public-facing communications networks.

    \frametitle{The Patching Imperative: Closing Security Gaps}
    
    \begin{block}{What is Patching?}
    \textbf{Patching} is the process of applying updates to software and systems to fix known vulnerabilities and improve functionality.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Unpatched vulnerabilities are among the most common attack vectors for breaches.
    \item Patches address security flaws, bugs, and performance issues in operating systems and applications.
    \item Critical vulnerabilities should be patched as quickly as possible after testing.
    \item Legacy and end-of-life systems pose particular patching challenges.
    \item A formal patch management process is essential for maintaining security posture.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Notable Examples}
