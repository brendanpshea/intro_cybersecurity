\frametitle{Securing the Enterprise: Why Mitigation Matters}

\begin{block}{Security Mitigation}
\textbf{Security mitigation} refers to measures taken to reduce the severity or impact of security threats.
\end{block}

\begin{itemize}
\item Security threats to enterprises have increased by over 300\% in the past decade.
\item A single data breach costs organizations an average of \$4.35 million globally.
\item \textbf{Proactive mitigation} is significantly more cost-effective than reactive responses.
\item Effective security requires multiple layers of protection working together.
\item Regulatory compliance often mandates specific security controls and mitigation strategies.
\end{itemize}
