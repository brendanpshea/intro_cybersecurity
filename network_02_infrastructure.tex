    \frametitle{What Makes Up a Network?}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Think of a Network Like a City}
        Just as a city needs roads, traffic lights, and postal services to function, a computer network needs various components to operate effectively.
    \end{alertblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Networks have three main types of components:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Network Appliances:} The physical or virtual "machines" that make networks work (like routers, switches, and firewalls).
            
            \item \textbf{Network Applications:} Special software that provides services over the network (like content delivery systems).
            
            \item \textbf{Network Functions:} Important features that help the network operate safely and efficiently (like traffic management).
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item When you connect to WiFi at a coffee shop, you're using:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A wireless access point (appliance)
            \item Web browsers and apps (applications)
            \item Security features to protect your data (functions)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    \frametitle{Physical vs Virtual Network Devices: What's the Difference?}
    
    \begin{block}{Understanding Through Examples}
        Think about the difference between a physical calculator and a calculator app on your phone - network devices can be either physical or virtual too!
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{columns}[t]
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \textbf{Physical Network Devices:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Actual hardware you can touch and see
                \item Like your home WiFi router
                \item Has its own power supply
                \item Dedicated to one specific task
                \item Can't be easily changed once built
            \end{itemize}
        \end{column}
        
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \textbf{Virtual Network Devices:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Software that acts like hardware
                \item Like having multiple calculators on one phone
                \item Runs on a computer
                \item Can do multiple tasks
                \item Easy to update and modify
            \end{itemize}

    \frametitle{Routers: The Internet Traffic Directors}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{What is a Router?}
        A \textbf{router} is like a traffic cop for the internet, directing data between different networks and helping information find the best path to its destination.
    \end{alertblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every time you access a website, routers help your data travel across multiple networks:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item From your home network to your ISP
            \item Through various internet service providers
            \item Across countries and continents
            \item Finally to the destination server
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Routers make decisions based on \textbf{IP addresses}, which are like the street addresses of the internet.
        
        \item They maintain special maps called \textbf{routing tables} to keep track of possible paths through the network.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Router Architecture and Key Features}
    
    \begin{tabular}{|p{0.3\textwidth}|p{0.6\textwidth}|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Purpose} \\
        \hline
        CPU & Processes routing decisions and manages device \\
        \hline
        RAM & Stores routing tables and device configuration \\
        \hline
        Flash Memory & Holds the router's operating system \\
        \hline
        Network Interfaces & Connect to different networks \\
        \hline
        Console Port & Allows direct management access \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each component plays a crucial role in:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Processing incoming data packets
            \item Making routing decisions
            \item Forwarding packets to their destination
            \item Maintaining network connectivity
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Network Switches: Building Local Networks}
    
    \begin{block}{Understanding Switches}
        If routers are like traffic cops directing cars between different cities, \textbf{switches} are like the local street system within a city, connecting all the buildings (devices) in your local network.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Switches learn which devices are connected to each port by remembering their \textbf{MAC addresses}.
        
        \item Unlike basic hubs that send data to everyone, switches are intelligent:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item They send data only to the intended recipient
            \item This increases network efficiency
            \item Provides better security
            \item Reduces unnecessary network traffic
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Most modern offices use switches to create their internal networks.
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Types of Switches: Layer 2 vs Layer 3}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Switches come in different types based on their capabilities:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Layer 2 Switches:} Basic network switching
            \item \textbf{Layer 3 Switches:} Combine switching and routing
            \item \textbf{PoE Switches:} Can power devices like phones and cameras
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item The choice depends on your network needs:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Size of your network
            \item Types of devices you're connecting
            \item Performance requirements
            \item Budget constraints
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{When to Use Layer 3 Switches}
        Layer 3 switches are ideal when you need routing capabilities within a large local network, such as a corporate office with multiple departments or a university campus.
    \end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Firewalls: Protecting Network Boundaries}
    
    \begin{block}{What is a Firewall?}
        A \textbf{firewall} acts like a security guard for your network, checking all incoming and outgoing traffic to protect against unauthorized access and cyber threats.
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Firewalls make decisions based on security rules:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Which applications can access the network
            \item Which websites users can visit
            \item What types of data can enter or leave
            \item Which devices can connect
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Every modern network needs firewall protection:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Home networks use simple firewall software
            \item Businesses use advanced firewall appliances
            \item Cloud networks use virtual firewalls
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Next-Generation Firewalls and Their Features}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{IDS/IPS: Monitoring and Protecting Networks}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Key Difference}
        While an \textbf{Intrusion Detection System (IDS)} alerts you about suspicious activity (like a security camera), an \textbf{Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)} actively blocks threats (like a security guard).
    \end{alertblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item These systems protect networks by:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Monitoring network traffic patterns
            \item Comparing activity against known threat signatures
            \item Detecting unusual behavior

            \item Access Control: Enforce usage policies
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Types of proxy servers:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Forward proxies (client protection)
            \item Reverse proxies (server protection)
            \item Transparent proxies (network control)
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Proxy Server Applications and Use Cases}

    \frametitle{Time to Live (TTL): Managing Packet Lifespans}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{What is TTL?}
        \textbf{Time to Live (TTL)} is like an expiration date for network packets, preventing them from circulating endlessly in the network if they can't reach their destination.
    \end{alertblock}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item TTL serves several important purposes:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Prevents infinite routing loops
            \item Limits packet lifetime in the network
            \item Helps troubleshoot network issues
            \item Controls cache duration for DNS records
        \end{itemize}
        
        \item Each router decreases the TTL value by 1:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Packet is discarded when TTL reaches 0
            \item Sender is notified of packet expiration
            \item Helps trace packet path through network
        \end{itemize}
