  \frametitle{Single Points of Failure: Avoiding Automation Pitfalls}
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Automated security systems can become \textbf{single points of failure (SPOF)} if not designed with redundancy.
    \item Dependency on a single automation platform creates risk if that platform experiences downtime or vulnerabilities.
    \item Security automation should include monitoring of the automation system itself to detect failures.
    \item Manual fallback procedures must be documented for critical security functions if automation fails.
  \end{itemize}
  
  \begin{block}{Automation Failure Example}

    \begin{semiverbatim}
# Example: Monitoring the automation system
def check_automation_health():
    for component in automation_components:
        status = component.get_status()
        if status != "operational":
            # Execute recovery procedure
            recovery_procedure(component)
            
            # Notify security team
            alert_security_team(f"Automation failure in {component.name}")
            
            # Activate manual fallback if needed
