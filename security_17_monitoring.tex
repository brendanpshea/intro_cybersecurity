\frametitle{Introduction to Security Monitoring: Why It Matters}
\begin{itemize}
\item Security breaches cost organizations an average of \$4.45 million per incident (2023 data).
\item Most successful attacks go undetected for over 200 days without proper monitoring.
\item Regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS) mandate security monitoring and incident reporting.
\item Early detection through monitoring significantly reduces the impact and cost of security incidents.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Real-World Example}
A major retailer detected unusual database query patterns through their monitoring system, identifying an active breach targeting customer payment data before any information was exfiltrated.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Systems Monitoring: Critical Components}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Systems monitoring} focuses on operating systems, host-based activities, and endpoint behaviors.
\item Key indicators include user authentication events, privilege escalation, and unauthorized software execution.
\item Host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) monitor for changes to critical system files and configurations.
\item Endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions provide detailed visibility into endpoint activities.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Critical System Events to Monitor}
Always prioritize monitoring for account creation, privilege changes, security policy modifications, and unusual process execution patterns.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Application Monitoring: Protecting Software Assets}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Application monitoring} focuses on the behavior and security of software running in your environment.
\item Applications generate valuable security data through their logs, transaction records, and error messages.
\item Web applications require special attention due to their exposure to external threats and common vulnerabilities.
\item Database activity monitoring helps detect unauthorized access to sensitive information.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item Key application monitoring points:
\begin{itemize}
\item Authentication attempts (successful and failed)
\item Authorization decisions and access control events
\item Input validation failures and unexpected exceptions
\item Changes to application configurations or permissions
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Infrastructure Monitoring: Networks, Servers, and Beyond}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Infrastructure monitoring} covers the foundational hardware, networking, and services supporting IT operations.
\item Network traffic analysis helps identify communication patterns that may indicate compromise or data exfiltration.
\item Server performance metrics can reveal resource exhaustion from denial-of-service attacks or crypto-mining malware.
\item Cloud infrastructure requires specialized monitoring approaches due to its dynamic and distributed nature.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Infrastructure Monitoring Example}
A sudden increase in outbound traffic during non-business hours from a server with no scheduled maintenance or backup activities warrants immediate investigation, as it may indicate data exfiltration.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Log Aggregation: Centralizing Security Data}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Log aggregation} is the process of collecting log data from disparate sources into a central repository.
\item Centralized logging provides a unified view of security events across the organization's entire environment.
\item Without aggregation, security teams must manually check multiple systems, making correlation nearly impossible.
\item Effective log aggregation preserves the original context and timestamps while normalizing formats for analysis.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Log Aggregation Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item Faster incident detection and investigation
\item Improved correlation of related events
\item Simplified compliance reporting
\item Preserved evidence for forensics
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{EXAMPLE: Log Aggregation in Practice}
\begin{itemize}
\item Consider a potential account compromise scenario spanning multiple systems.
\item Without log aggregation, these events appear as isolated incidents on different systems.
\item With centralized logging, the pattern becomes clear: a coordinated attack targeting a specific user.
\item The timeline view reveals the attack progression and enables rapid response.
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{Effective Alerting Strategies: When and How}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alerting} is the mechanism for notifying security personnel when suspicious or malicious activity is detected.
\item Good alerts are actionable, contain relevant context, and include clear severity classifications.
\item Alert fatigue occurs when too many notifications overwhelm analysts, causing important alerts to be missed.
\item Tiered alerting routes different severity levels to appropriate personnel through different channels.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Alert Design Principles}
Every alert should answer: What happened? Where did it happen? When did it happen? What is the potential impact? What action should be taken?
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{EXAMPLE: Crafting Actionable Security Alerts}
\begin{itemize}
\item Compare these two alerts for the same security event.
\item The improved alert provides context, impact assessment, and recommended actions.
\item Including relevant data within the alert reduces investigation time.
\item Standardized alert format ensures consistent interpretation and response.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Data Archiving: Retention Policies and Compliance}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Security data archiving} preserves historical security information for investigations and compliance.
\item Retention policies must balance storage costs with security and regulatory requirements.
\item Different data types may require different retention periods based on their value and compliance needs.
\item Archived data must remain searchable and retrievable while maintaining its integrity and chain of custody.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Common Retention Requirements}
Financial institutions often must retain security logs for 7 years under various regulations, while healthcare organizations following HIPAA typically maintain security records for 6 years from creation or last effective date.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Alert Response Fundamentals: The First 15 Minutes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Alert response} is the process of investigating and addressing security notifications in a timely manner.
\item The first 15 minutes are critical for containing potential damage and preserving evidence.
\item Triage determines whether an alert represents a true security incident or a false positive.
\item Having documented response procedures speeds reaction time and ensures consistent handling.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Initial Response Checklist}
\scriptsize
\begin{enumerate}
\item Acknowledge the alert and confirm receipt
\item Validate the alert is a genuine security concern
\item Assess the potential scope and impact
\item Initiate containment if an active threat is confirmed
\end{enumerate}
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Remediation Strategies: Fixing Security Issues}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Remediation} is the process of correcting security issues identified through monitoring and alerts.
\item Effective remediation addresses not just symptoms but root causes to prevent recurrence.
\item Prioritization ensures critical vulnerabilities affecting high-value assets are fixed first.
\item Documentation of remediation actions creates an audit trail and knowledge base for similar future incidents.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Remediation Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Patching}: Applying software updates to fix known vulnerabilities
\item \textbf{Configuration changes}: Adjusting settings to enhance security
\item \textbf{Compensating controls}: Implementing alternative safeguards when direct fixes aren't possible
\item \textbf{Security hardening}: Removing unnecessary services and strengthening defenses
\end{itemize}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Validation: Ensuring Threats Are Truly Resolved}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Validation} confirms that remediation efforts have successfully resolved security issues.
\item Re-testing after remediation verifies that vulnerabilities are actually fixed, not just superficially addressed.
\item Regression testing ensures that security fixes don't introduce new problems or vulnerabilities.
\item Continuous monitoring after remediation watches for any signs of recurring issues or persistent threats.
\end{itemize}

\begin{exampleblock}{Validation Methods}
For a patched web application vulnerability, validation might include: re-scanning with vulnerability scanners, manual penetration testing of the specific vulnerability, reviewing application logs for exploit attempts, and monitoring for unexpected behavior.
\end{exampleblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Quarantine Procedures: Isolating Compromised Assets}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Quarantine} is the isolation of compromised systems to prevent lateral movement and damage spread.
\item Network segmentation enables quick isolation of affected systems while maintaining business operations.
\item Automated quarantine can trigger based on specific high-confidence alerts for immediate containment.
\item The level of isolation should be proportional to the threat severity and confidence level.
\end{itemize}

\begin{alertblock}{Quarantine Considerations}
When quarantining systems, always consider business impact versus security risk, maintain forensic integrity, document all actions taken, and establish clear criteria for releasing systems from quarantine.
\end{alertblock}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{EXAMPLE: Quarantine Workflow for Malware Detection}
\begin{itemize}
\item This workflow shows the decision process and actions when malware is detected on a corporate system.
\item The initial alert triggers an escalating response based on confirmation and risk assessment.
\item Note the balance between security needs and business continuity considerations.
\item Communication steps ensure all stakeholders remain informed throughout the process.
\end{itemize}

\begin{block}{Quarantine Decision Flow for Malware Incidents}
\scriptsize

\item If Confirmed Threat: Proceed to Risk Assessment
\item If High/Critical Risk: Implement Network Isolation
\item Conduct Forensic Evidence Capture
\item Perform Remediation
\item Validate Effectiveness
\item Return System to Service
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
    \frametitle{Alert Tuning: Reducing False Positives}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alert tuning} is the ongoing refinement of detection rules to improve accuracy and relevance.
    \item False positives waste analyst time and contribute to alert fatigue, reducing overall security effectiveness.
    \item Tuning requires balancing sensitivity (not missing threats) with precision (avoiding false alarms).
    \item Keep a record of tuning changes to maintain awareness of detection coverage and potential blind spots.
    \end{itemize}
    
    \begin{block}{Alert Tuning Approaches}
    \scriptsize
    \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Thresholding}: Adjusting when alerts trigger based on frequency or magnitude
    \item \textbf{Contextual filtering}: Adding business context to reduce noise (e.g., maintenance windows)
    \item \textbf{Whitelisting}: Explicitly excluding known-good activities from generating alerts
    \item \textbf{Correlation rules}: Requiring multiple conditions before alerting
    \end{itemize}
